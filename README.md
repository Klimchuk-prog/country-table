Create a table-view of countries. The list should include the following data as a minimum (in any order):
● ISO code
● Country name
● Country flag
● Continent
2. The list of countries can be fetched through GraphQL from https://countries.trevorblades.com/ . When data is
being fetched, a loading indicator should appear.
3. It should be possible to sort and filter on all elements in the list. This part should take place on the client-side.
